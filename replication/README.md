# Reuse Study Replication Package

This package contains the scripts and information required to replicate our findings.

The data source we used in our study is World of Code (WoC) infrastructure. This resource is available for anyone who is interested in doing research in OSS and you may visit https://worldofcode.org/ to get access to it.

We provide the scripts that work on WoC servers and will reproduce the same results.

The contents are:  
- scripts: scripts that run on WoC to gather data  
    - annote*.perl: annotating copy instances  
    - blobs.sh: blob-level data
    - project_sample.py & projects.sh: project-level data
    - survey.sh & survey.ipynb: survey sampling
- analysis: code written in R for statistical analysis  
- survey: the survey questionnaire
